In my PhD I had to treat a lot of data so I have a bit of experience with data science, although most of it with R and other statistical software.

I want to change from academia and get into the private sector (not necessarily an environment-related sector)

I expect to improve my skills on data analysis and also add a bit of machine learning.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* Which industry will you seek employment in? 
I am not sure about this yet. I would prefer to work with something related to environmental sciences but anything related 
with data science is interesting at this point since I am really interested in learning about this field.
* What will your future role look like?
I would like to work as a data scientist, more oriented to technical stuff.
* What is your career goal?
I am not sure about a long-term career goal since I am still new to the field.
