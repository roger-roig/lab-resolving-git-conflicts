# Who am I

* I'm from Barcelona but I am currently living in a village called Cardedeu
* I am an environmental scientist with a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences
* In my PhD I had to treat a lot of data so I have a bit of experience with data science, although most of it with R and other statistical software.

# Why am I here

* I want to change from academia and get into the private sector (not necessarily an environment-related sector)
* I expect to improve my skills on data analysis and also add a bit of machine learning.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* I would prefer to work with something related to environmental sciences but anything related 
with data science is interesting at this point since I am really interested in learning about this field.
* I would like to work as a data scientist, more oriented to technical stuff.
* I am not sure about a long-term career goal since I am still new to the field.
